#eCommerce Transactions Data Science Project
This project involves analyzing an eCommerce Transactions Dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning Models, and Customer Segmentation Techniques. The dataset consists of three files: Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv, which contain customer details, product information, and transaction history. The goal is to extract valuable business insights, build a Lookalike Model to find similar customers, and perform clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Key tasks include data visualization, identifying trends, and applying clustering algorithms to segment customers. The Lookalike Model recommends similar customers based on their purchase history using similarity scoring. The final submission includes well-documented Jupyter Notebooks and reports, providing insights and recommendations that can help improve eCommerce strategies.
